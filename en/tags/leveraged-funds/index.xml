<p>The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: &ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.&rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money:</strong> James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it&rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Leveraged Funds:</strong>  Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Keys to Investment Success:</strong> James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and &ldquo;unfeeling&rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach.</li>
<li><strong>Market Cycles:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Money and Values:</strong> Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one&rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things.</li>

</h2>
<p><strong>IIM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong>  How to understand some people&rsquo;s &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; with money while being &ldquo;generous&rdquo; towards their pets.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others&rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to evaluate investment advice received from others?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>   The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It&rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iny:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong>  Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James&rsquo;s investment approach.  This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong>  How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haoqing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared 1:</strong>  An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared 2:</strong> Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Becky:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared:</strong> As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments.</li>
<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong>  James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2:</strong>  How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents?
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees&rsquo; learning progress.
<ul>
<li><strong>James&rsquo;s Response:</strong> James stated he wouldn&rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can&rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees&rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to buy is when you have money.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overcoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of a &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; is relative.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to change other people&rsquo;s values.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone has their own values and ways of life. It&rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Espionage is everywhere.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Integration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects.
&ndash; Haoqing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best judgments are validated by facts.
&ndash; Mike</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your attitude determines my response.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.<br>
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies have lifecycles.  Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Bank Policy and the Economy:</strong> Central banks primarily focus on inflation and unemployment. Economic recessions are typically accompanied by rising unemployment, prompting central banks to implement policies like quantitative easing to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.  For instance, quantitative easing during the subprime mortgage crisis and the pandemic aimed to address rising unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Chinese Stocks:</strong> James reiterates his advice against investing in Chinese stocks, using his personal experience of recommending selling off Chinese stocks at the beginning of the US-China trade war as evidence of their risk.  He mentions Nio&rsquo;s price surge from $16 to $30-$40, followed by a significant drop, illustrating the high volatility and risk associated with Chinese stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Strategy:</strong>  James emphasizes that asset allocation and the amount of capital available for investment are two distinct concepts.  The correct buying strategy is &ldquo;buy when you have money,&rdquo; not dollar-cost averaging. This is similar to the 401k or retirement account investment strategy, where early investment is encouraged to maximize the benefits of compounding.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance Choices:</strong>  He advises against purchasing commercial insurance, particularly investment-linked insurance products, arguing that they offer low returns and poor liquidity. He recommends Term Life Insurance and Medical Care insurance for managing unforeseen risks.  For example, a Term Life policy might cost only a few hundred dollars a year for $1 million in coverage. He discourages purchasing other commercial insurance products like long-term care insurance and universal life insurance, viewing them as a waste of money that could be better used for investments.</li>
<li><strong>The Concept of Leveraged Investing:</strong>  James introduces the concept of leveraged investing, suggesting that borrowing at low interest rates to invest in high-return assets can be a sound strategy. For example, with loan interest rates at 2%-7% and potential asset appreciation of 10%-12%, leveraged investing can be more profitable in the long run. He illustrates this with a hypothetical example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, your assets will remain at $1 million after ten years. However, if you borrow money to invest that $1 million, even after deducting annual expenses and 7% interest, your assets could grow to $30 million in 30 years, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million.</li>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: You use T-Mobile; why don&rsquo;t you have Starlink as a backup?</li>
<li>Answer: My apartment building doesn&rsquo;t allow Starlink installation, and the T-Mobile signal is generally good. Network interruptions are rare and usually resolved by restarting the router.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: Some YouTubers claim that the central bank ignores economic recessions.</li>
<li>Question: Is this true?</li>
<li>Answer: The central bank focuses on the unemployment rate, which is highly correlated with economic recessions.  Therefore, the central bank doesn&rsquo;t ignore recessions, but rather focuses on a different indicator.  Many YouTubers are not professional financial advisors; don&rsquo;t be misled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Can I dollar-cost average into leveraged funds in my retirement account without rebalancing?</li>
<li>Answer: Your question indicates a misunderstanding of asset allocation.  Asset allocation and dollar-cost averaging are different concepts.  The correct buying strategy is &ldquo;buy when you have money.&rdquo; Leveraged funds are volatile and are better purchased in a lump sum.  The same applies to QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: A friend surrendered their investment-linked insurance policy and invested the proceeds in 00670L (2x leveraged ETF), recovering their losses within two weeks.</li>
<li>Summary: Don&rsquo;t be trapped by sunk costs. Cut your losses promptly and reallocate your assets effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wolf:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m ten years from retirement with limited retirement savings. Can I take advantage of market downturns to buy QLD in my Roth IRA and convert my 401k to cash?</li>
<li>Answer:  With limited Roth IRA funds, you should invest entirely in leveraged funds.  Hold an equivalent amount of cash in your 401k. For example, if you buy $100,000 of QLD, hold $100,000 in cash in your 401k. If your Roth IRA only has $30,000, invest it all in TQQQ and hold $60,000 cash in your 401k. This strategy aims for higher returns due to the Roth IRA&rsquo;s lower contribution limits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: The devaluation of the Malaysian currency brings to mind the impact of migration on currency, such as wealthy individuals from Hong Kong migrating. How does the US avoid currency devaluation, and do US companies benefit from the US dollar?</li>
<li>Answer: A country&rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by its industries and national strength.  The US has four pillars: government, finance, corporations, and national defense.  Whether US companies benefit from the dollar is uncertain, but they are undoubtedly protected by the US government.  James uses a hypothetical &ldquo;James currency&rdquo; (10 point) example:  The value of a currency depends on the issuer&rsquo;s services and creditworthiness.  For example, 10 points could be exchanged for a meal. If others recognize the value of the James currency, it can circulate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Do you still consider market cycles in your investing approach?</li>
<li>Answer: I will continue to discuss cycles, but cycle-based trades will be anticipated, potentially three months, six months, or even a year in advance, and may be incorrect. I will no longer advocate for all-in/all-out strategies, but rather adjusting Beta. This is because managing a large volume of funds from many individuals makes rapid market entry and exit difficult and prone to market impact.  It&rsquo;s better to invest the annual $7,000 contribution as a lump sum rather than in installments; long-term performance will likely be better.  Lump-sum investing in the US market has historically outperformed dollar-cost averaging or periodic investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YJ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Why allocate to 00864B?  Why is 00757 no longer recommended?  What advice do you have for Taiwanese investors?</li>
<li>Answer: Asset allocation strategies are generally universal. 00864B is similar to a US dollar time deposit but carries exchange rate risk. Refer to the 2021-2022 videos for information on 00757. The main difference between investing in Taiwan and the US lies in pledging.  Maintain a loan-to-value ratio above 167%, avoid pledging all assets, and diversify pledges across multiple financial institutions to mitigate the risk of credit lines being reduced. For instance, if you have $50 million in assets, don&rsquo;t pledge all of it; start by pledging 1/3, enough to cover your needs, and seek other financial institutions for additional pledging needs. Taiwanese financial institutions have fluctuating credit lines, so be cautious.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Little John:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Why borrow against assets instead of selling stocks?</li>
<li>Answer:  Pledging assets offers lower interest rates (2%-7%) compared to the potential for higher asset appreciation (10%-12%).  Using loans for investment is more cost-effective and avoids capital gains taxes from selling stocks.  Example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, you&rsquo;ll still have $1 million after ten years. But if you borrow and invest, even after 30 years of expenses and interest payments, your assets could grow to $30 million, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million after paying off the loan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cristina:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Questions about annuities and what to do with funds after selling a house.</li>
<li>Answer: Avoid annuities; surrender them if you have any.  Proceeds from a house sale cannot be put into an IRA or Roth IRA; they should be placed in a brokerage account.</li>
</ul>
