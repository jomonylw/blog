[{"content":" I. Main Topic # The theme of this session is Embrace the New Bull Market and Invest Long-Term. James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection. Do not invest in the Chinese stock market: The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years. Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Retired Doctor Poch:\nSharing: After learning about James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy, he found a more relaxing and suitable investment method.

Question 2: The return on cash allocation will decrease in the interest rate cut cycle. Is it still necessary to allocate cash?

Main Topic # This episode primarily discusses proper investment philosophy, ways to avoid investment traps, and the implications of China\u0026rsquo;s latest economic policies for the global market. James emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds, particularly QQQ, and reminds investors to maintain emotional control and not be swayed by market fluctuations. He uses specific examples and data to illustrate the concept of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth,\u0026rdquo; while also analyzing China\u0026rsquo;s recently introduced series of economic stimulus policies, believing them to be a positive signal for a global economic recovery.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy: Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets. Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation. Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%. Adhere to the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary. Scam Avoidance Guide: Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments. Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels. Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products. Regarding Real Estate Investment: James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation. He advocates for a \u0026ldquo;rent instead of buy\u0026rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns. Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment. New Trends in China\u0026rsquo;s Economy: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth. These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China\u0026rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery. Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds. INGYNYING:\nSharing: INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods. Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to respect family members\u0026rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas. Allen:\nQuestions: Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed. Eric:\nQuestion: Eric\u0026rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be handled? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses. Dean:\nSharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean\u0026rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child. Michael:\nQuestions: How to secure a loan from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan? James\u0026rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click \u0026ldquo;Order Now\u0026rdquo;, and select \u0026ldquo;Finance\u0026rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes. Alternative options include choosing an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ. EVA:\nQuestion: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances. If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns. Jenny:\nQuestions: Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it. Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels. Haoqing:\nSharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals. Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams. Jason:\nSharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps. Amy:\nSharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification. Becky:\nSuggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams. Mike:\nQuestion: What are your thoughts on China\u0026rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen. Julia:\nQuestion: Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit\u0026rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet. IV. Noteworthy Points # “You have enough money when you have enough.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.\n\u0026ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth\u0026rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.\n“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.” \u0026ndash; James\nNowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.\n“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; James\nWithin the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.\nV. Summary # This episode is packed with valuable information and insights. It not only reiterates the importance of long-term index fund investment but also offers practical tips on scam prevention and provides an in-depth analysis of China\u0026rsquo;s newest economic policies. It is recommended to apply this knowledge to your investment practices and strive for financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article serves solely as personal study notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Session # The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.\u0026rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.\nII. Briefing Highlights # Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money: James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money. Risks of Leveraged Funds: Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management. Keys to Investment Success: James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and \u0026ldquo;unfeeling\u0026rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach. Market Cycles: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success. Money and Values: Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one\u0026rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IIM:\nShared: A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others. Question 1: How to understand some people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; with money while being \u0026ldquo;generous\u0026rdquo; towards their pets. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another. Question 2: How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others\u0026rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them. Brian:\nShared: Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice. Question: How to evaluate investment advice received from others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently. Iny:\nShared: Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James\u0026rsquo;s investment approach. This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income. Question: How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment. Haoqing:\nShared 1: An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay. Shared 2: Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths. Becky:\nShared: Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues. Mike:\nShared: As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments. Question 1: Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal. Question 2: How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent. Question 3: Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees\u0026rsquo; learning progress. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can\u0026rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees\u0026rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions. IV. Noteworthy Insights # The best time to buy is when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nMany obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.\nTo succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices. \u0026ndash; James\nOvercoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.\nTo achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.\nThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;benefactor\u0026rdquo; is relative. \u0026ndash; James\nPeople perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to change other people\u0026rsquo;s values. \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has their own values and ways of life. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.\nEspionage is everywhere. \u0026ndash; James\nInformation security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.\nAcquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos. \u0026ndash; James\nIntegration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.\nThe US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nWithin the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.\nThe best judgments are validated by facts. \u0026ndash; Mike\nThe success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.\nYour attitude determines my response. \u0026ndash; James\nJames adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.\nInvesting in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.\n\u0026ndash; James\nCompanies have lifecycles. Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.\nV. Summary # This live session once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing while reminding attendees to stay rational, patient, and vigilant. James addressed attendees\u0026rsquo; questions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and the relationship between money and values, sharing personal experiences and insights.

Theme of the Episode # The theme of this episode is \u0026ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.\u0026rdquo; The core viewpoints are: Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.\nII. Summary of the Briefing # Wealth is a Gift: Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that \u0026ldquo;wealth is a gift,\u0026rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth. The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest: Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment. High Risk, High Return?: High risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ. Choosing Investment Targets: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years. Investment Mindset: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you. Do Not Blindly Trust External Information: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy. Balancing Risk and Reward: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: What do you think about the idea that \u0026ldquo;investing is simple\u0026rdquo;?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment. Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t understand index investing?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual. LAN:\nQuestion 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value. Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher. Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value. Question 4: For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Don\u0026rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term. Nai Xin:\nSharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success. Jason:\nSharing: Understanding \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money,\u0026rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes. IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that \u0026ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.\u0026rdquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns. Hai Rui Ji:\nSharing:\nThank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together. James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.** Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment. Question: Already answered in the video.\nLi Zi:\nSharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of \u0026ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.\u0026rdquo; T:\nQuestion 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries. Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels. IV. Key Takeaways # Wealth is a Gift \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.\nLearning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily \u0026ndash; IM\nLearning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean \u0026ndash; Li Zi \u0026amp; James\nOnly after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.\nThe More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have \u0026ndash; James\nUnderstand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.\nCash is Air \u0026ndash; James\nCash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.\nV. Summary # This live stream focused on the theme of \u0026ldquo;Wealth is a gift.\u0026rdquo; James explained the importance of investing and financial management, the advantages of index investing, the relationship between risk tolerance and investment returns, and how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in a simple and profound way. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively questioned their own issues and confusions. James patiently and meticulously answered them by combining practical cases and his own experience, helping the students better understand and master the knowledge and methods of investing and financial management. He also guided the students to overcome psychological barriers in investments, establish a firm long-term investment philosophy, and ultimately achieve financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article is a personal learning summary and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session focused on the nature of capitalism and a brainless investment strategy. James criticized the current financial education system for \u0026ldquo;enslaving\u0026rdquo; the masses, arguing that it\u0026rsquo;s designed to create workers, not capitalists. He stressed the importance of asset allocation and understanding the true meaning of wealth to achieve financial freedom in a capitalist society.\nII. Briefing Content # The Essence of Capitalism: James likened capitalism to a massive AI, with complex and opaque operating mechanisms that can easily lead to confusion. He argued that capitalism is not inherently evil but a tool, the key being the user\u0026rsquo;s mindset and approach. Similar to the emergence of AI, capitalism also evolved from simple buy-and-sell relationships, its complexity making it difficult to predict and understand. Brainless Investing Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Buy when you have money, and never sell.\u0026rdquo; He emphasized index fund investing, particularly the Nasdaq-100 index fund (QQQ), as the core investment vehicle. He opposed over-diversification, believing that focusing on the US market is more effective due to its fairness, justice, and openness. The Importance of Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is the core of investing, and it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to develop a suitable strategy based on individual circumstances. James provided relevant links and video resources to help the audience learn more. A safe and sound asset allocation should be able to cope with market fluctuations, ensuring that even if the market drops to zero, one can still maintain their lifestyle for many years. He highlighted the concept of \u0026ldquo;being able to live comfortably for over a decade regardless of market fluctuations.\u0026rdquo; The True Meaning of Financial Freedom: True financial freedom is not just about possessing wealth but also about \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; This means understanding one\u0026rsquo;s asset situation and knowing how much can be freely spent annually and monthly. He emphasized the concept of \u0026ldquo;knowing what to spend and spending it freely when desired.\u0026rdquo; Parenting and Responsibility: He encouraged young people to have children and cultivate their sense of responsibility and financial awareness from a young age, enabling them to be self-reliant. He shared his experience of educating his daughter, emphasizing the importance of letting children bear the consequences of their actions, starting with small things. The Meaning of Learning: The purpose of learning is not just for monetary gain but for ultimate enlightenment. One should absorb knowledge like a sponge, cultivate thinking abilities, and ultimately reach the state of \u0026ldquo;decreasing knowledge to gain wisdom.\u0026rdquo; He used the example of martial arts manuals to illustrate that learning is a process from having something to having nothing. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # YJ:\nSharing: Discussed the lack of financial education in Asia, using the moon analogy to illustrate the differences between Eastern and Western education. Mentioned the inspirational Jewish financial education book, Talmud. Question: How to educate children about finances from a young age. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age, let them understand the meaning of wealth, and encourage them to start financial planning and investment early. Avoid the negative views on money held by older generations. Ying Nuo:\nSharing: Shared the enlightenment gained after learning James\u0026rsquo;s investment philosophy and how they implemented a simple asset allocation strategy, feeling secure and stable. Question: Question about the pledging ratio. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Corrected the concept of the pledging ratio, emphasizing that retirees should pledge or borrow 2% of their total assets for living expenses, and young people should choose QQQ for better growth potential. IM:\nSharing: Shared the simplicity and convenience of ETF investing, along with experiences sharing investment philosophies with friends and their views on having children. Question: Whether one should \u0026ldquo;know too much\u0026rdquo; in investing and life, and whether concerns about the future and AI would affect the willingness to have children. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the importance of learning, but emphasized the need to learn to subtract, filtering out unimportant knowledge and information. \u0026ldquo;Gaining knowledge daily, losing wisdom daily.\u0026rdquo; Encouraged young people not to be afraid of having children, sharing his understanding of the meaning of life - \u0026ldquo;The meaning of life lies in creating the next generation of life in the universe.\u0026rdquo; Chang An:\nSharing: Shared news about a government department in China buying Nasdaq funds and becoming the largest shareholder. Question: The implications of this action and its connection to US-China relations. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Affirmed the investment behavior of the government department, believing it to be the correct way to manage finances, and encouraged other government departments to learn from it. He believed that governments should also engage in asset allocation. Sam:\nSharing: Shared entrepreneurial experiences and reflections on blind expansion, as well as personal confusion about retirement and future life. Question: Preparing for retirement but feeling lost about the future state of life and unsure how to prepare. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Retirement is not the only option, listen to your inner voice, and find a lifestyle that makes you happy. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-plan the future; things will work out. He also suggested that Sam think about streamlining company processes, improving efficiency, and making employees happier at work. Jason:\nSharing: Examples of young people staying at home after graduating from university. Question: How to help young people find meaning in life. James\u0026rsquo;s Reply: Cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from an early age and let them learn to be self-reliant. Parents should not over-pamper their children, let them take responsibility, and encourage them to enter society and serve others. He used his own daughter as an example to illustrate how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility from a young age. IV. Key Takeaways # Spending money is moral. \u0026ndash; James\nSpending money should not be seen as negative; knowing how to spend and being willing to spend is the only way to truly enjoy the freedom that wealth brings. Also emphasized taking advantage of credit card benefits, points, etc.\nThe more we know, the greater the risks we don\u0026rsquo;t know. \u0026ndash; James\nAs our knowledge increases, we need to be more cautious in identifying and assessing potential unknown risks. The real risk is the unknown risk.\nThe class of those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ndash; James\nThere is a disparity in information and knowledge in capitalist society, leading to class differentiation between those who know and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. Wealth and capital are concentrated in the hands of a few.\nI may not know where I\u0026rsquo;m sailing, but I know there are some paths I can no longer take. \u0026ndash; Sam\nOn the road of life, clarifying what you don\u0026rsquo;t want is more important than knowing what you want.\nV. Conclusion # This session covered investment philosophy, life philosophy, parenting experiences, and more. James, with his unique perspective and sharp language, criticized the shortcomings of the current financial education system, proposed a \u0026ldquo;brainless investing\u0026rdquo; strategy, and emphasized the importance of asset allocation and \u0026ldquo;knowing how to spend.\u0026rdquo; He also discussed topics such as how to cultivate children\u0026rsquo;s sense of responsibility and finding one\u0026rsquo;s purpose in life, encouraging the audience to actively think about the meaning of life and contribute to society.\nDisclaimer: This article is only for personal learning notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Theme # This session centers around the importance of psychological resilience in investing. James\u0026rsquo;s core message is that mental strength is the key to investment success, while other skills and calculations are secondary. Investors need to maintain a highly optimistic mindset, viewing market fluctuations as opportunities rather than crises in the long run. Long-term investing, rational analysis, and maintaining a healthy mindset are more crucial than striving for precise calculations.\nII. Briefing Content # Correction on 401(k) and IRA: James corrects a statement from the previous session regarding 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, clarifying that the limits for each are independent, but that IRAs have income restrictions. He provides further explanations about the Backdoor Roth IRA conversion, advising listeners to manage pre-tax and after-tax funds carefully to avoid account confusion and complications during tax filing. Asset Allocation Strategy: He emphasizes the significance of asset allocation and suggests listeners refer to existing articles and Excel spreadsheets for simulations, discouraging impulsive decision-making. He offers various asset allocation plans catering to different risk tolerances and retirement stages, stressing the concept of \u0026ldquo;fuzzy accuracy\u0026rdquo; – that it is not necessary to pursue overly precise ratios, but ensuring sufficient cash reserves is crucial. Example: A listener proposes an allocation of 60% QQQ and 40% cash, which James believes carries a risk of bankruptcy and advises them to consult the provided asset allocation plans. Leveraged ETFs and Rebalancing: Using QQQ\u0026rsquo;s beta value of 1.0 as a benchmark, he simplifies beta calculations for leveraged ETFs, for instance, QLD is considered 2.0. He recommends a gradual approach when adjusting beta during rebalancing, advising against drastic changes. For investors with earned income, the frequency and ratio of rebalancing can be more flexible. Example: He suggests that young investors can rotate investments among QQQ, QLD, and TQQQ every six months, then rebalance at the end of the year. Long-Term Investing and Market Volatility: James reiterates the importance of long-term investing, using the dot-com bubble of 2000 as an example to demonstrate that long-term investors ultimately profit, even after enduring prolonged market downturns. Market dips are opportunities, and investors should remain optimistic, buying whenever they have funds available. He refutes the notion that \u0026ldquo;investments in 2000 took 15 years to break even,\u0026rdquo; emphasizing that the market always recovers in the long run. Example: An investment of $5 million at the peak of the market in 2000, despite experiencing the burst of the internet bubble, would still have grown to $32.375 million by 2024. Brokerage Selection: He advises choosing brokerages with physical branch offices and understanding how stocks and cash are held in custody to ensure asset security. Example: He explains the risks of nominee accounts and recommends selecting brokerages that allow for direct ownership of stocks, encouraging listeners to inquire about the brokerage\u0026rsquo;s custodian banks for stocks and cash. Purpose of Holding Cash: He underlines that cash holdings are meant for emergencies and to seize buying opportunities during market downturns, not for pursuing interest income. Example: He suggests maintaining a 20% cash position, a portion of which can be utilized for adding to leveraged ETFs during dips. Investment Target Selection: He recommends selecting suitable investment targets based on individual circumstances. For instance, retirees or individuals with limited funds may consider high-dividend ETFs, while younger individuals or those with ample funds should focus on growth-oriented ETFs like QQQ. Example: Addressing a listener holding SCH, James advises them to assess whether high-dividend ETFs are appropriate based on their asset level and annual expenses. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Danny:\nShares: He has been following James\u0026rsquo;s investment strategy for three years and achieved a return of approximately 35%. Chang\u0026rsquo;an:\nQuestion: Brokerage security and recommendations in Hong Kong. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Choose brokerages with physical branch offices in the region, understand the custodian banks for stocks and cash, and avoid easily dissolved online brokerages. Eric:\nShares: He began investing during the pandemic, experienced the hardships of short-term trading, and eventually recognized the importance of long-term investing and psychological control. He uses the example of Jesse Livermore to illustrate the risks of trading. Jessie:\nShares: Both she and her husband are nearing 60 years old, and a portion of their investment funds comes from a mortgage loan. She expresses concerns about a potential market crash and the risk of USD devaluation. Questions: How to cope with a possible future market crash, especially with a mortgage due before retirement? What about USD devaluation? Are there risks associated with concentrating large sums of money in a single brokerage account? Is it feasible to refinance the mortgage in five years or repay it early with funds from the investment account? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The market is unlikely to experience losses within a 15-year timeframe. Ensure you can comfortably handle mortgage payments for the next 13 years; the most secure approach is to sell the house and repay the loan. He declines to answer hypothetical questions. Stocks are registered under the investor\u0026rsquo;s name, hence the risk of brokerage failure is manageable. Refinancing or early repayment is not recommended. Excessive focus on short-term interest gains is akin to \u0026ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish,\u0026rdquo; and ultimately increases risk. Sam:\nShares: He went all-in on QQQ, but after some short-term trading, realized it wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for him and experienced psychological pressure due to large position fluctuations. Question: How to overcome the psychological pressure brought about by fluctuations in a large portfolio? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Focus on realized gains rather than unrealized gains. Maintain 20% cash and 20% leveraged ETFs to stabilize your mindset. Exercise caution with short-term trading, as it may not be sustainable in the long run. Haoqing:\nShares: He uses examples of friends gambling and raising children to illustrate the importance of moderate expectations and nurturing interests. He compares and contrasts education philosophies and Nobel Prize achievements between China and the US, emphasizing the significance of financial freedom for the next generation. IV. Highlights # Mental fortitude is the equipment for investing, it determines whether you will succeed. \u0026ndash; James\nInvestment skills and calculations are undoubtedly important, but psychological resilience is the ultimate factor that decides investment success. Even for simple index fund investing, a sound mental state is needed to navigate market volatility.\nA market downturn is not a disaster, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. \u0026ndash; James\nFrom a long-term investment perspective, market downturns provide excellent opportunities to acquire high-quality assets. Maintain a long-term outlook and don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by short-term fluctuations.\nThere should be a limit to human pessimism. \u0026ndash; James\nExcessive pessimism and worry are detrimental to investments. One should rationally analyze risks and develop sensible coping strategies. Do not let extreme scenarios or low-probability events unduly influence investment decisions.\nParents sometimes have these expectations for their children, don\u0026rsquo;t impose your unfulfilled aspirations on them. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nParents should respect their children\u0026rsquo;s individuality and interests and refrain from forcing their own unaccomplished goals onto them. Allowing children to have a joyful childhood and the autonomy to choose their own paths in life is more important than chasing conventional success.\nV. Summary # In this session, James reiterates the importance of mental fortitude in investing and the effectiveness of long-term investment and asset allocation strategies. By addressing listeners\u0026rsquo; practical concerns, such as retirement planning, market volatility, and capital security, he helps them better understand and apply these investment principles. James also provides advice on choosing appropriate investment targets and the purpose of holding cash, aiding listeners in constructing more comprehensive investment strategies. Haoqing\u0026rsquo;s sharing sparked reflection on educational philosophies and life values, advocating for a focus on children\u0026rsquo;s overall development and mental well-being.\nDisclaimer: This document is only for personal learning and note-taking purposes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This session centered around investment cycles, exploring how to assess market cycles, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between acting too early and making wrong judgments during cycle shifts. It used Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as a case study. Additionally, it discussed risks related to real estate investment, insurance, and stock pledges, while providing an in-depth analysis of asset allocation strategies, particularly comparing and recommending approaches for the Taiwanese and US markets.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Cycles\nInvestor sentiment is likened to a pendulum, swinging between extreme fear and extreme optimism. Differentiating between premature judgments and incorrect ones during cycle changes is challenging, as exemplified by Buffett\u0026rsquo;s public announcement of buying stocks in late 2008, followed by a further 30% market decline. Swing trading is no longer recommended, as the market perpetually rises, making long-term investment the key. Risks of Real Estate Investment\nReal estate investment is considered high-risk, requiring maintenance and incurring high holding costs like property taxes and HOA fees. US property tax is a holding tax; the longer you hold, the more tax you pay. Rental yields are low, around 2% in the US Bay Area after deducting expenses. The biggest risks of buying a house are job loss and having outstanding mortgage debt at retirement. Insurance Choices\nAvoid commercial insurance, such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, universal life insurance, etc. Necessary insurance includes health insurance and term life insurance. Term life insurance is suitable for those who are the sole income source for their family, providing support for children under 18. Risks of Stock Pledging\nStock pledging is extremely risky, especially in the Taiwanese market, with a maintenance ratio requirement of 167%. Absolutely forbid using borrowed funds from stock pledges for reinvestment. In Taiwan, leveraged ETFs can be pledged, but risks still exist. Be cautious about diversifying risks in stock pledging in Taiwan. Do not pledge all assets to the same financial institution, and avoid pledging everything at once. Taiwanese investors are advised to adopt the \u0026ldquo;Situation 3\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy: 30% cash, 30% leverage, and 40% QQQ or other broad-based index funds. Asset Allocation Strategies\nWhen selecting investment targets, understand their risk and return characteristics, and allocate assets reasonably based on your circumstances. Long-term investment in QQQ index funds is like piloting an aircraft carrier—stable and offering considerable returns. Investing in individual stocks and sectors is like sailing a small boat—high risk and susceptible to market fluctuations. Investments in individual stocks and sectors are similar to the once-booming railway industry, which was eventually replaced by new technologies and industries. For example, the semiconductor industry may also be eliminated in the future. QQQ index funds have a replacement mechanism to promptly remove underperforming stocks, maintaining overall growth momentum. Investing in individual stocks requires the ability to identify potential opportunities and understand market and industry trends, as exemplified by James\u0026rsquo; interaction with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s CEO before its IPO and his purchase of Amazon shares during its slump. For retirement accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to invest all Rust account funds in leveraged ETFs, while 401K accounts can hold cash or bonds. Be cautious when borrowing for investment; ensure cash flow can cover interest payments and manage risks effectively. In the US, if capital gains tax is implemented, consider transferring funds to other countries. Avoid investing in the Chinese market due to policy risks and economic downturn pressures. Do not purchase annuity products; they offer low returns and carry risks. After selling a house, do not deposit funds into IRA or traditional IRA accounts. Be decisive in investing and avoid hesitation. For example, loss-making properties should be sold as soon as possible, and the funds should be invested in the stock market. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Eric:\nSharing: Used the analogy of QQQ index funds being like aircraft carriers and individual stocks being like small boats to illustrate the advantages of index fund investing. Sharing: James\u0026rsquo; channel not only shares investment knowledge but also many life stories, such as estate planning and tax planning, from which valuable lessons can be learned. Brian:\nQuestion: For employed individuals using the \u0026ldquo;Situation 2\u0026rdquo; asset allocation strategy, is it possible to set a higher Beta value, such as 1.1 or 1.2? Answer: There is no upper limit for Beta, as long as cash is at least twice the amount of borrowed funds. Excel spreadsheets can be used to simulate investment outcomes under different scenarios, allowing adjustments based on individual risk tolerance. Mike:\nSharing: The US is like a Bogue bird, adept at concealing its strength and waiting for the opportune moment to reap the rewards, which aligns with the long-term investment philosophy. Question: Will the central bank ignore economic recession and focus solely on inflation? Answer: The central bank will not ignore economic recession because it leads to increased unemployment, which is one of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s key concerns. Economic recession and unemployment are closely related. Cheng Ge (PC):\nSharing: Illustrated the drawbacks of investment-linked insurance policies through a real-life case study, recommending early surrender and transferring funds to QQQ index funds to recoup losses within a shorter timeframe and achieve higher returns. Lang:\nQuestion: Is it feasible to utilize market downturns to buy QLD leveraged ETFs using a Roth IRA account and convert a 401K account to cash, aiming to increase the proportion of funds in the Roth IRA account? Answer: If Rust account funds are limited, they should all be invested in leveraged ETFs. The 401K account can hold cash as a hedge. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to wait for market downturns to make the switch; asset allocation should be completed as early as possible. Tina:\nQuestion: If the 401K account is already maxed out, is it still possible to invest in an IRA account? Answer: After maxing out the 401K account, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA account, but you can contribute to a Roth IRA account. Specific eligibility depends on income level and IRA contribution limits. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to check the IRA contribution limit for relevant information. IAM:\nQuestion: Will events like the Malaysian currency devaluation and the Hong Kong emigration wave impact the US economy and the US dollar? How does the US prevent currency devaluation? Will the companies in the QQQ index fund be affected? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by national industries and power. The US possesses strong national strength and diversified industries, allowing the US dollar to maintain its strong position. The US government will safeguard the interests of American companies and citizens. It\u0026rsquo;s uncertain whether US companies will be directly affected by US dollar devaluation, but they will undoubtedly be protected by the US government. TT:\nQuestion: Are you still considering cycle investing at present? Answer: Yes, cycle investing will be considered, but not through the all-in, all-out approach used in the past. Instead, Beta adjustments will be employed to navigate market volatility, as it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for a large number of investors to keep up with rapid trading, thus requiring a more robust strategy. Question: Which US political party, Democrat or Republican, is more favorable to investors? Answer: In the long run, policies of both parties have minimal impact on investors. The market adjusts according to policies; for example, higher tax rates may induce investors to hold assets for longer periods. YJ:\nQuestion: Are there any differences in asset allocation strategies between Taiwan and the US? What is the role of the 00864B bond? Why is investing in 00757 no longer recommended? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are universally applicable. The main differences between Taiwan and the US lie in stock pledging rules and leveraged ETF choices. 00864B can be used as a cash alternative, similar to a USD fixed deposit. Reasons for no longer recommending investment in 00757 can be found in the videos from 2021 and 2022. Jason:\nQuestion: Can dollar-cost averaging (DCA) be used to invest in leveraged ETFs like Q2D? Answer: When investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of DCA. Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. IV. Key Takeaways # QQQ index funds are like aircraft carriers, offering stability and substantial returns, while individual stock and sector investments are like sailing small boats, carrying high risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations. \u0026ndash; James \u0026amp; Eric\nChoosing long-term investment in QQQ index funds can mitigate the risks associated with individual stocks and sector investments, providing more stable returns.\nThe central bank will not disregard economic recession, as it leads to rising unemployment, a key indicator that the central bank monitors. \u0026ndash; James\nOne of the objectives of the central bank\u0026rsquo;s monetary policy is to maintain low unemployment; therefore, it will not stand idly by in the face of economic recession.\nLoss aversion is a common mistake among investors. Losses should be cut promptly, and funds should be reallocated to higher-quality assets. \u0026ndash; Cheng Ge (PC)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to overcome the psychological barrier of loss aversion in investing, decisively cutting losses to prevent them from escalating.\nThe US\u0026rsquo;s national strength rests on four pillars: government, the financial industry, businesses, and national defense. These four pillars work in synergy to achieve strategic goals. \u0026ndash; James\nAmerica\u0026rsquo;s robust, comprehensive national strength is the cornerstone of the US dollar\u0026rsquo;s strong position.\nIn the long term, policies of both US parties have a limited impact on investors; the market adjusts itself based on policies. \u0026ndash; James\nThe market has a self-regulating mechanism, enabling it to adapt to various policy environments.\nWhen investing in any asset, including leveraged ETFs, lump-sum purchasing should be adopted instead of dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Returns from DCA are likely to be lower than lump-sum purchasing. \u0026ndash; James\n\u0026ldquo;Buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; is the investment strategy James consistently emphasizes. DCA is less efficient for long-term investment.\nV. Summary # This session primarily revolved around investment cycles, with James explaining how to identify market cycles and emphasizing the distinction between premature and incorrect judgments, using Buffett\u0026rsquo;s actions during the 2008 financial crisis as an example. Furthermore, it provided detailed insights into the risks of real estate investment, insurance selection, stock pledging, and asset allocation strategies. In the Q\u0026amp;A segment, students raised questions and shared their perspectives on topics such as the aircraft carrier investment strategy, property tax, central bank policy, currency devaluation, and investment strategy in the Taiwanese market. James offered comprehensive answers to each question and reiterated the importance of long-term investment in QQQ index funds, along with the \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money\u0026rdquo; investment strategy.\nDisclaimer: This document is for personal learning and note-taking purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice.
