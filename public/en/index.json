James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection. Do not invest in the Chinese stock market: The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years. Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Retired Doctor Poch:\nSharing: After learning about James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy, he found a more relaxing and suitable investment method. Question: How to obtain a stable cash flow after retirement? Is it necessary to adjust the investment strategy of 00662? Answer: The investment target can be adjusted according to the size of the retirement fund. Choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 with lower volatility to guarantee cash flow. IM:\nSharing: He tried to guide his child to invest by matching contributions and increased his vigilance against high-yield traps. Question 1: How to guide a child to invest and prevent them from spending investment income? Answer: Emphasize that investment is a long-term behavior. Income cannot be withdrawn for consumption. Funds should grow continuously through compound interest. Question 2: How to choose a safe and reliable trust company? How to avoid the traps of high-yield trust products? Answer: Any trust company that promises high returns may be a scam. You should take control of your own investment and financial management rights, clearly stipulate investment in index funds in the trust clause, and set up a regulatory unit to ensure fund security. Rose:\nSharing: She frankly talked about her past investment failures and the process of gradually establishing the correct investment concept under the guidance of James. Question 1: What are the differences and pros and cons of Margin Loan and Pledge Loan? The interest rate of Margin Loan from IB is relatively low. Is it necessary to transfer to Charles Schwab for Pledge Loan? Answer: Margin Loan is riskier, and Pledge Loan is relatively safe. If the interest rate of IB\u0026rsquo;s Margin Loan is low, you can continue to use it, but pay attention to controlling the borrowing ratio, preferably no more than 20%. Question 2: The return on cash allocation will decrease in the interest rate cut cycle. Is it still necessary to allocate cash? Answer: The purpose of cash allocation is not for profit but to deal with contingencies, such as unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. Question 3: How to manage children\u0026rsquo;s investment accounts? Under whose name should it be, yours or the child\u0026rsquo;s? Answer: It is recommended to open an account in the child\u0026rsquo;s name to cultivate their financial management concept, but control the amount and provide proper investment guidance. Estate planning can be done after the child becomes an adult. Phoenix:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about handling company stock options and finally adopted James\u0026rsquo; suggestion. Question 1: How to deal with the stock options of unlisted companies? Answer: If the company has a high possibility of going public, it is recommended to sell it to an investment company before the listing to get cash and invest in QQQ. Question 2: What do you think of Bitcoin? Can I invest in it? Answer: If you already hold a small amount of Bitcoin, you can continue to hold it, but do not invest any more capital. It is recommended to focus on investing in QQQ. Allen:\nSharing: He shared his questions about 401k and stock investment and eventually made adjustments under James\u0026rsquo; advice. Question 1: What should I do if I have too much money in my 401k account? Answer: It is recommended to stop making further contributions to 401k and transfer some funds to the Roth IRA account through the Backdoor Roth IRA. Question 2: How to switch from holding Nvidia stock to QQQ? Answer: Sell Nvidia stock as soon as possible, transfer funds to QQQ, and pledge stocks to borrow money to pay taxes. Haoqing:\nSharing: He demonstrated the difficulty of stock selection through data analysis and illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in QQQ with practical examples. Question: Can stock picking beat QQQ? Answer: Stock selection is difficult to outperform QQQ in the long run. Even if it beats the market in the short term, transaction costs and taxes need to be considered. Invest in index funds for the long term. Xiang:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about saving for children\u0026rsquo;s education and inheritance and finally found a solution under James\u0026rsquo; advice. Question 1: Is it better to use a 529 Education Fund or invest in QQQ for children\u0026rsquo;s education savings? Answer: Investing in QQQ is recommended because it has higher long-term returns and is more flexible. Question 2: How to do estate planning? Answer: For larger estates, it is recommended to set up an irrevocable trust and consult an estate lawyer for planning. Kevin:\nSharing: Frankly admitted his past investment failures and regained confidence under the guidance of James, starting to embark on the road of steady investment. Question: How many listeners are losing money on investments? Answer: Past investment experience is not important. What is important is to establish the correct investment concept and believe in the value of long-term investment in index funds. Julia:\nSharing: Shared her lessons learned from investing in Chinese concept stocks and second-tier growth stocks, and how to guide children to make long-term investments. Question 1: How to deal with losses caused by investment in Chinese concept stocks and second-tier growth stocks? - Answer: It is advisable to \u0026ldquo;cut your losses\u0026rdquo; and switch funds to QQQ in a timely manner. Question 2: How to guide children to make long-term investments? - Answer: You can use an investment calculator to show children the power of compound interest and guide them with your own investment experience. Peter:\nSharing: Shared his experience working at Apple and confirmed that many high-income earners also choose to invest in index funds. Question: How to balance family expenses and investment? - Answer: It is recommended to use stock pledges to borrow money to meet living expenses and continue investing in QQQ, so that assets can continue to grow through compound interest. Jason:\nSharing: He shared his confusion about company tax declaration and finally found a suitable solution under James\u0026rsquo; advice. Question: How to choose the tax filing method? Answer: If your income is low, you can choose to file a 1099; if your income is high, you are advised to establish an S Corporation. Cindy:\nSharing: Shared her experience of guiding her child to invest in Roth IRA and keep away from gambling. Question: How to guide children to invest in Roth IRA? How to guide children to stay away from gambling? Answer: Open a Roth IRA account for the child and make matching contributions. Lead by example and educate your child with the experiences and stories of people around you. IV.

Main Topic # This lecture focuses on how to make sound asset allocation and investment decisions amidst economic fluctuations and market uncertainty. The core message is to prioritize long-term, value-based investing, avoid chasing market highs and lows, and develop a rational investment strategy based on individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Avoid blindly following trends and emotional market reactions.\nII. Lecture Summary # Central Bank Policy and the Economy: Central banks primarily focus on inflation and unemployment. Economic recessions are typically accompanied by rising unemployment, prompting central banks to implement policies like quantitative easing to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. For instance, quantitative easing during the subprime mortgage crisis and the pandemic aimed to address rising unemployment. Risks of Chinese Stocks: James reiterates his advice against investing in Chinese stocks, using his personal experience of recommending selling off Chinese stocks at the beginning of the US-China trade war as evidence of their risk. He mentions Nio\u0026rsquo;s price surge from $16 to $30-$40, followed by a significant drop, illustrating the high volatility and risk associated with Chinese stocks. Asset Allocation Strategy: James emphasizes that asset allocation and the amount of capital available for investment are two distinct concepts. The correct buying strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money,\u0026rdquo; not dollar-cost averaging. This is similar to the 401k or retirement account investment strategy, where early investment is encouraged to maximize the benefits of compounding. Insurance Choices: He advises against purchasing commercial insurance, particularly investment-linked insurance products, arguing that they offer low returns and poor liquidity. He recommends Term Life Insurance and Medical Care insurance for managing unforeseen risks. For example, a Term Life policy might cost only a few hundred dollars a year for $1 million in coverage. He discourages purchasing other commercial insurance products like long-term care insurance and universal life insurance, viewing them as a waste of money that could be better used for investments. The Concept of Leveraged Investing: James introduces the concept of leveraged investing, suggesting that borrowing at low interest rates to invest in high-return assets can be a sound strategy. For example, with loan interest rates at 2%-7% and potential asset appreciation of 10%-12%, leveraged investing can be more profitable in the long run. He illustrates this with a hypothetical example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, your assets will remain at $1 million after ten years. However, if you borrow money to invest that $1 million, even after deducting annual expenses and 7% interest, your assets could grow to $30 million in 30 years, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Mike:\nQuestion: You use T-Mobile; why don\u0026rsquo;t you have Starlink as a backup? Answer: My apartment building doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow Starlink installation, and the T-Mobile signal is generally good. Network interruptions are rare and usually resolved by restarting the router. Mike:\nComment: Some YouTubers claim that the central bank ignores economic recessions. Question: Is this true? Answer: The central bank focuses on the unemployment rate, which is highly correlated with economic recessions. Therefore, the central bank doesn\u0026rsquo;t ignore recessions, but rather focuses on a different indicator. Many YouTubers are not professional financial advisors; don\u0026rsquo;t be misled. Jason:\nQuestion: Can I dollar-cost average into leveraged funds in my retirement account without rebalancing? Answer: Your question indicates a misunderstanding of asset allocation. Asset allocation and dollar-cost averaging are different concepts. The correct buying strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money.\u0026rdquo; Leveraged funds are volatile and are better purchased in a lump sum. The same applies to QQQ. PC:\nComment: A friend surrendered their investment-linked insurance policy and invested the proceeds in 00670L (2x leveraged ETF), recovering their losses within two weeks. Summary: Don\u0026rsquo;t be trapped by sunk costs. Cut your losses promptly and reallocate your assets effectively. Wolf:\nQuestion: I\u0026rsquo;m ten years from retirement with limited retirement savings. Can I take advantage of market downturns to buy QLD in my Roth IRA and convert my 401k to cash? Answer: With limited Roth IRA funds, you should invest entirely in leveraged funds. Hold an equivalent amount of cash in your 401k. For example, if you buy $100,000 of QLD, hold $100,000 in cash in your 401k. If your Roth IRA only has $30,000, invest it all in TQQQ and hold $60,000 cash in your 401k. This strategy aims for higher returns due to the Roth IRA\u0026rsquo;s lower contribution limits. IAM:\nComment: The devaluation of the Malaysian currency brings to mind the impact of migration on currency, such as wealthy individuals from Hong Kong migrating. How does the US avoid currency devaluation, and do US companies benefit from the US dollar? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by its industries and national strength. The US has four pillars: government, finance, corporations, and national defense. Whether US companies benefit from the dollar is uncertain, but they are undoubtedly protected by the US government. James uses a hypothetical \u0026ldquo;James currency\u0026rdquo; (10 point) example: The value of a currency depends on the issuer\u0026rsquo;s services and creditworthiness. For example, 10 points could be exchanged for a meal. If others recognize the value of the James currency, it can circulate. T:\nQuestion: Do you still consider market cycles in your investing approach? Answer: I will continue to discuss cycles, but cycle-based trades will be anticipated, potentially three months, six months, or even a year in advance, and may be incorrect. I will no longer advocate for all-in/all-out strategies, but rather adjusting Beta. This is because managing a large volume of funds from many individuals makes rapid market entry and exit difficult and prone to market impact. It\u0026rsquo;s better to invest the annual $7,000 contribution as a lump sum rather than in installments; long-term performance will likely be better. Lump-sum investing in the US market has historically outperformed dollar-cost averaging or periodic investments. YJ:\nQuestion: Why allocate to 00864B? Why is 00757 no longer recommended? What advice do you have for Taiwanese investors? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are generally universal. 00864B is similar to a US dollar time deposit but carries exchange rate risk. Refer to the 2021-2022 videos for information on 00757. The main difference between investing in Taiwan and the US lies in pledging. Maintain a loan-to-value ratio above 167%, avoid pledging all assets, and diversify pledges across multiple financial institutions to mitigate the risk of credit lines being reduced. For instance, if you have $50 million in assets, don\u0026rsquo;t pledge all of it; start by pledging 1/3, enough to cover your needs, and seek other financial institutions for additional pledging needs. Taiwanese financial institutions have fluctuating credit lines, so be cautious. Little John:\nQuestion: Why borrow against assets instead of selling stocks? Answer: Pledging assets offers lower interest rates (2%-7%) compared to the potential for higher asset appreciation (10%-12%). Using loans for investment is more cost-effective and avoids capital gains taxes from selling stocks. Example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, you\u0026rsquo;ll still have $1 million after ten years. But if you borrow and invest, even after 30 years of expenses and interest payments, your assets could grow to $30 million, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million after paying off the loan. Cristina:\nQuestion: Questions about annuities and what to do with funds after selling a house. Answer: Avoid annuities; surrender them if you have any. Proceeds from a house sale cannot be put into an IRA or Roth IRA; they should be placed in a brokerage account. IV. Key Takeaways # The central bank\u0026rsquo;s primary focus is the unemployment rate; economic recession and unemployment are closely related. \u0026ndash; James\nIn response to Mike\u0026rsquo;s question about the central bank\u0026rsquo;s focus.\nAsset allocation strategy and the amount of capital are distinct; the buying strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have the money.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; James\nAddressing Jason\u0026rsquo;s question about dollar-cost averaging into leveraged funds.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be trapped by sunk costs; cut your losses promptly. \u0026ndash; PC\nPC shared an anecdote about a friend who cut losses on an investment and quickly recovered by investing in a leveraged ETF.\nTiming the Market is always wrong. \u0026ndash; James\nJames repeatedly emphasized this point when students asked about market timing.\nHesitation is the worst thing in investing. \u0026ndash; James\nJames\u0026rsquo;s response to Cristina\u0026rsquo;s question about handling real estate sales.\nV. Conclusion # This lecture reinforces James\u0026rsquo;s consistent investment philosophy, emphasizing the importance of long-term, value-based investing and risk management. He uses clear language and relatable examples to answer students\u0026rsquo; questions about asset allocation, insurance choices, retirement account investments, currency value, and real estate investments, tailoring his advice to the specific context of Taiwanese investors. He encourages the audience to ask questions, think critically, and develop personalized investment strategies based on their circumstances.\nDisclaimer: This article represents personal notes and should not be considered financial advice.
