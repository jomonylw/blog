James believes that the global monetary easing policy and the rapid development of AI technology herald the arrival of a new bull market. He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.\nII. Content Summary # A new bull market is coming: The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise. Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund: QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target. Individual stocks are unreliable: Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection. Do not invest in the Chinese stock market: The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years. Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan: American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas. Leveraging through stock pledges: Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible. Plan for retirement early: Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size. Emphasize family education: Parents should cultivate their children\u0026rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example. Don\u0026rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products: Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false. The dangers of short-term trading: Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns. The purpose of cash allocation: It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Retired Doctor Poch:\nSharing: After learning about James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy, he found a more relaxing and suitable investment method.

Question 2: The return on cash allocation will decrease in the interest rate cut cycle. Is it still necessary to allocate cash?

Main Topic # This episode primarily discusses proper investment philosophy, ways to avoid investment traps, and the implications of China\u0026rsquo;s latest economic policies for the global market. James emphasizes the importance of long-term investment in index funds, particularly QQQ, and reminds investors to maintain emotional control and not be swayed by market fluctuations. He uses specific examples and data to illustrate the concept of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth,\u0026rdquo; while also analyzing China\u0026rsquo;s recently introduced series of economic stimulus policies, believing them to be a positive signal for a global economic recovery.\nII. Briefing Content # Investment Philosophy: Emotions are the biggest enemy in investing. You need to avoid being influenced by news and information, stay rational, and refrain from chasing rising or falling markets. Investing requires a long-term perspective, aiming for a timeframe of 40 years or more. Warren Buffett acquired 99% of his wealth after the age of 50, demonstrating that patience is key to wealth creation. Choose investment targets that are consistently stable and provide high returns. Index funds are the best option, especially QQQ, which boasts a long-term annualized return of 14%. Adhere to the \u0026ldquo;never sell\u0026rdquo; strategy to allow assets to continue appreciating. Avoid selling stocks unless absolutely necessary. Scam Avoidance Guide: Be wary of various investment traps. Do not trust any projects that guarantee high returns, especially those that require you to sell existing assets for new investments. Do not readily believe any investment or financial management information received via phone, text messages, or online platforms. Any information involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official channels. Be cautious of aggressive sales tactics from financial institutions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid being lured by various fancy financial products. Regarding Real Estate Investment: James advises against homeownership for average working individuals, believing it turns them into \u0026ldquo;mortgage slaves\u0026rdquo; burdened with heavy loan pressure, hindering wealth accumulation. He advocates for a \u0026ldquo;rent instead of buy\u0026rdquo; approach, suggesting using a stock pledge loan to rent high-quality housing at lower interest rates, then investing the saved funds for higher returns. Consider purchasing real estate only when your assets reach a certain scale and you can comfortably afford the payment. New Trends in China\u0026rsquo;s Economy: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China recently introduced a series of potent fiscal policies, including reserve requirement ratio and interest rate cuts, injecting funds into banks, and encouraging stock purchases, to stimulate economic growth. These policies will contribute positively to stabilizing China\u0026rsquo;s real estate market, boosting consumer confidence, and promoting global economic recovery. Investors should pay attention to developments in the Chinese market and seize new investment opportunities. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Through conversations with individuals of different age groups, IM discovered that most people have insufficient awareness of long-term savings and are often constrained by mortgages and other factors. By comparing the returns of index funds in different countries and regions with those of fixed deposits and pensions, IM illustrated the advantages of long-term investment in index funds. INGYNYING:\nSharing: INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s mother wanted to sell all her assets to purchase a house but, after persuasion, realized that this would lead to losing opportunities for asset appreciation. Many of INGYNYING\u0026rsquo;s friends are afraid of change, preferring to endure the hardships of their current situation rather than attempt new investment methods. Question: How to convince family members to accept new investment concepts? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Utilize data and case studies for illustration, such as comparing the long-term returns of fixed deposits and index funds, and sharing success stories of investors. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to respect family members\u0026rsquo; choices and refrain from forcing them to accept new ideas. Allen:\nQuestions: Should someone with assets worth 50 times their annual living expenses use their salary to pay for a car? How can a couple combine their stock accounts for collateral purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: It is recommended to utilize Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website loan to purchase a vehicle, then use funds from a stock pledge loan to repay the car loan. Dedicate your salary entirely to investment. Couples can combine their accounts through a joint account for collateral, sharing the limit, while their accounts remain individually managed. Eric:\nQuestion: Eric\u0026rsquo;s mother is visiting the US and is concerned about medical expenses. How should this be handled? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Purchasing travel insurance is advised, but excessive worry is unnecessary. Most non-emergency situations can be treated back home. If encountering extremely high medical costs, attempting negotiation with the hospital or seeking alternative solutions is possible. Due to the specific circumstances of foreign nationality and lack of income, the hospital may choose not to pursue the medical expenses. Dean:\nSharing: Dean purchased a new car using Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website loan and a stock pledge loan, conserving a significant amount of capital. Learning about investing boosted Dean\u0026rsquo;s confidence to decline a high-paying job and choose to stay home with their child. Michael:\nQuestions: How to secure a loan from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s official website for a car purchase? Can funds from 401k or IRA accounts be used for collateral? What are the options if QQQ is not available in their company\u0026rsquo;s 401k plan? James\u0026rsquo; answer: To apply for a car loan through Tesla\u0026rsquo;s website, choose the desired model and configuration, click \u0026ldquo;Order Now\u0026rdquo;, and select \u0026ldquo;Finance\u0026rdquo;. Funds in retirement accounts cannot be used as collateral; it is recommended to transfer part of those funds to a brokerage account for collateral purposes. Alternative options include choosing an S\u0026amp;P 500 index fund or inquiring with the company about the possibility of Blockage Link to invest in QQQ. EVA:\nQuestion: As a single, middle-aged woman with limited savings, how to balance work and investment? Should selling the house be considered for investment purposes? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Continue working diligently while consistently making monthly investments. Even small amounts will accumulate over 8-9 years, reaching the threshold for collateral, allowing you to leverage and accelerate wealth growth. Selling a house for investment is an option but requires careful consideration based on personal circumstances. If renting is more cost-effective, choose to rent and allocate the funds to investments yielding higher returns. Jenny:\nQuestions: Any knowledge regarding the latest Roth SEP IRA policy? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is quite recent, and the accuracy of the $69,000 limit requires verification. Consulting with professionals like a financial advisor at Chase or Lisa is recommended. As it is a new product, not all institutions may offer it. Sharing: Jenny shared a personal experience of being scammed, reminding everyone to exercise caution and avoid trusting any investment information, particularly those spread through unofficial channels. Haoqing:\nSharing: Haoqing relayed the experiences of close friends falling victim to scams, lamenting that scam tactics are constantly evolving and are hard to guard against, even for highly educated individuals. Question: How can investment concepts be better conveyed to people around us to prevent them from being deceived? Is there a need to explain professional investment knowledge? James\u0026rsquo; answer: Avoid explaining intricate investment knowledge; simply emphasize the core principle of long-term investment in index funds. Excessive professional details may confuse them, making them more susceptible to being misled by other investment information and ultimately falling prey to scams. Jason:\nSharing: Recounted an NFT scam incident encountered on Clubhouse, warning everyone to be wary of risks in the cryptocurrency world. Expressed gratitude toward James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy for helping them avoid such traps. Amy:\nSharing: Amy shared personal encounters with scams, including impersonations of government departments and courier companies. She emphasized the importance of relying only on written communication and ignoring any investment information delivered through phone calls or text messages. Amy suggested that, when in doubt, contact official channels for clarification. Becky:\nSuggestion: Avoid answering calls from unfamiliar numbers, set up spam filters, and use a less important email address when necessary to share personal information to minimize the risk of scams. Mike:\nQuestion: What are your thoughts on China\u0026rsquo;s most recent economic policies? Are they sustainable? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The People\u0026rsquo;s Bank of China has introduced powerful policies that are having a positive impact on economic confidence. Investors should keep an eye on these developments. Although the policies appear to be heading in a positive direction, their sustainability remains to be seen. Julia:\nQuestion: Any updates on the Roth SEP IRA policy? Are there any financial institutions already offering related products? James\u0026rsquo; answer: The policy information is fairly new, and the $69,000 limit\u0026rsquo;s accuracy is debatable. Consulting with a professional is advised. Being a new product, not all institutions might offer it yet. IV. Noteworthy Points # “You have enough money when you have enough.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany individuals believe that having just enough to get by is sufficient. This is a mistaken notion, as money is never truly enough. True financial freedom lies in possessing the power of choice – going wherever you want, doing whatever you desire – instead of being constrained by finances.\n\u0026ldquo;Never borrow money for investments.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Many people\nMany believe that borrowing for investment is unwise; however, this viewpoint is overly cautious. True investors, like Warren Buffett, skillfully leverage debt. Following the principle of \u0026ldquo;borrow for consumption, invest for asset growth\u0026rdquo;, the correct approach is to use borrowed money for expenses and personal money for investment. This enables rapid wealth accumulation.\n“All investment information received through phone calls, text messages, or online platforms is not trustworthy.” \u0026ndash; James\nNowadays, numerous scams operate through these channels. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to exercise caution and avoid blindly believing any financial advice or information. Anything involving bank accounts or government departments must be verified through official sources. Additionally, seeking guidance from qualified professionals is essential.\n“Investment must be consistently stable over the long term, which is why index funds are the only viable option.\u0026quot; \u0026ndash; James\nWithin the complex investment landscape, index funds stand out as a few reliable options capable of offering consistent stability and high returns. Index funds are like living organisms; they will never die, whereas all individual stocks will eventually disappear within a century. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for generational wealth, index funds are the way to go.\nV. Summary # This episode is packed with valuable information and insights. It not only reiterates the importance of long-term index fund investment but also offers practical tips on scam prevention and provides an in-depth analysis of China\u0026rsquo;s newest economic policies. It is recommended to apply this knowledge to your investment practices and strive for financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article serves solely as personal study notes and does not constitute any investment advice.

Topic of the Session # The session centered on the core principle of long-term investment strategies. James reiterated his investment philosophy: \u0026ldquo;Buy QQQ whenever you have money and hold it for the long term.\u0026rdquo; The discussion expanded to cover aspects like investment philosophy, risk management, and values, incorporating current events and questions from attendees. James also shared insights from legendary investors like Warren Buffett, encouraging attendees to cultivate a sound investment mindset.\nII. Briefing Highlights # Buying at the Dip vs. Buying When You Have Money: James cited research from ChatGPT, indicating that even with the ability to accurately predict and buy at market dips, the long-term returns differed minimally compared to simply buying when one has available funds. Over a 20-year period, the difference was merely 8%, translating to a difference in annualized returns of less than 0.2%. Hence, rather than expending time and effort predicting market bottoms, it\u0026rsquo;s more effective to seize opportunities and buy QQQ when you have the money. Risks of Leveraged Funds: Using the 2000 tech bubble as an example, James explained how leveraged funds can accelerate losses in bear markets, potentially leading to devastating financial setbacks, even bankruptcy. He simulated a scenario where an investor repeatedly buys more leveraged funds as the market declines, culminating in financial ruin. This served as a cautionary tale against the \u0026ldquo;buy the dip\u0026rdquo; strategy with leveraged funds, emphasizing the importance of risk management. Keys to Investment Success: James emphasized that the key to successful investment lies in overcoming human weaknesses. Maintaining a detached and \u0026ldquo;unfeeling\u0026rdquo; attitude towards invested capital and short-term market fluctuations is crucial for adhering to a long-term investment approach. Market Cycles: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t teach attendees about predicting market cycles or any trading techniques. He considers these unimportant and prone to misinterpretation and misapplication, potentially leading to increased risks. He advocated for a long-term investment strategy, likening it to riding a cable car, a smooth and steady ascent to the summit of financial success. Money and Values: Acknowledging that individuals have different values regarding money, James advised understanding and respecting diverse values, discouraging attempts to impose one\u0026rsquo;s own values upon others. He used the example shared by an attendee about a mother preferring a financial subsidy over a family trip to illustrate the diverse ways people assign value to things. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IIM:\nShared: A story about a deceased friend, leading to reflections on money and values, and expressing confusion about balancing personal values with those of others. Question 1: How to understand some people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;frugality\u0026rdquo; with money while being \u0026ldquo;generous\u0026rdquo; towards their pets. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: People manage their finances differently based on what they consider important and valuable. What might be significant to one person may hold little value for another. Question 2: How to understand a mother who prioritizes money over a family trip? How to better understand the needs of others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This mother might have certain unmet needs, possibly requiring material security before pursuing leisurely experiences. Understanding true needs involves offering more choices (e.g., money plus a trip). Avoid trying to change others\u0026rsquo; values; focus on understanding and respecting them. Brian:\nShared: Encountering a friend who suggested leveraging to purchase Nvidia stock, leading to questions about investment advice. Question: How to evaluate investment advice received from others? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The validity of investment advice depends on individual judgment and risk tolerance. It\u0026rsquo;s important to avoid blindly following the advice of others and to think independently. Iny:\nShared: Experiencing a sense of calm and reduced anxiety after adopting James\u0026rsquo;s investment approach. This newfound peace of mind allows for dedicating more time to important matters like family, and interestingly, focusing on work has led to increased income. Question: How to understand the phenomenon of increased income resulting from a dedicated focus on work? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: This exemplifies the principle that altruism ultimately benefits oneself. By focusing on serving clients and enhancing product or service quality, one ultimately gains client recognition and rewards, leading to higher income and a sense of accomplishment. Haoqing:\nShared 1: An experience with check fraud, prompting concerns about bank security and the risks of using checks. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Banks do not verify the identity of check depositors. Checks present security vulnerabilities, making it advisable to use safer online banking and digital payment methods like Apple Pay. Shared 2: Thoughts on the decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia, attributing this to factors like US regulations, labor laws, and unions. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: The decline of US manufacturing and the rise of Asia are multifaceted issues stemming from a complex interplay of factors, including national policies, labor laws, and unions. While Asian countries might resort to suppressing labor rights and environmental regulations to gain a competitive edge, the US places a higher value on worker well-being and environmental protection. This divergence in values contributes to different developmental paths. Becky:\nShared: Based on personal experience working in a digital payment company, Becky recommended that everyone stop using checks due to inherent security risks. Digital payment methods offer greater security and convenience, with features such as spending alerts that enable prompt response and recovery in case of issues. Mike:\nShared: As a long-time follower of James, Mike witnessed the evolution of his investment philosophy, from initially holding 30% SPY to converting to 100% QQQ, and eventually incorporating leveraged funds. He also shared personal investment experiences, like selling NIO and allocating a portion of his portfolio to private market investments. Question 1: Is investing in Intel after its acquisition worthwhile? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James advised against investing in large companies that are acquisitive. Acquisitions often lack efficiency, posing integration challenges and potentially hindering productivity. While acquiring smaller companies for technological advantages makes sense, acquiring large companies is akin to amassing a pile of scrap metal. Question 2: How to view the supply chain security concerns stemming from the US outsourcing 3C product manufacturing, citing examples like the BBB Call explosion and walkie-talkie incidents? James\u0026rsquo;s Response: Espionage is ubiquitous, and supply chain security is just one facet of this broader issue. Governments might implant spy codes in chips and software for surveillance purposes. Explosions are a relatively rudimentary form of espionage; more sophisticated methods can be extremely difficult to detect and prevent. Question 3: Is it possible to offer advanced courses for more experienced attendees? He suggested using portfolio sharing as a means to differentiate attendees\u0026rsquo; learning progress. James\u0026rsquo;s Response: James stated he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between attendees nor offer advanced courses. Assessing whether a student is genuinely learning is primarily based on their attitude, not investment returns or holding duration. Even portfolio sharing can\u0026rsquo;t truly gauge learning progress. James mentioned his personal sensitivity to words and language, enabling him to discern learning attitudes from attendees\u0026rsquo; emails and the way they pose questions. IV. Noteworthy Insights # The best time to buy is when you have money. \u0026ndash; James\nMany obsess over finding the perfect entry point, but research indicates that even if you could perfectly time market dips, the long-term returns barely differ from simply buying when funds are available. Instead of wasting time trying to predict the market, seize the opportunity and act promptly.\nTo succeed in investing, you must be indifferent to the money you invest and the fluctuations in stock prices. \u0026ndash; James\nOvercoming the human tendency to fixate on money and fear short-term market swings is essential for maintaining a long-term investment strategy and achieving stable returns.\nTo achieve effortless investing, you need to be numb to money. \u0026ndash; James\nWhen investing becomes a habit, free from emotional impulses and external distractions, you can achieve optimal results.\nThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;benefactor\u0026rdquo; is relative. \u0026ndash; James\nPeople perceive and absorb information differently. Who you consider a benefactor might not be perceived as such by others.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to change other people\u0026rsquo;s values. \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has their own values and ways of life. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand and respect diverse choices.\nEspionage is everywhere. \u0026ndash; James\nInformation security is a growing concern. Be vigilant and protect your personal data.\nAcquisitions of large companies are generally inefficient, and leaders who are fond of acquisitions usually have inflated egos. \u0026ndash; James\nIntegration complexities and high management costs associated with mergers often outweigh the benefits gained.\nThe US excels in areas such as finance and technology design, while Asian countries can only substitute and supplement in specific aspects. \u0026ndash; Haoqing\nWithin the global division of labor, different countries have distinct strengths and weaknesses, leading to divergent paths of development.\nThe best judgments are validated by facts. \u0026ndash; Mike\nThe success of an investment philosophy is ultimately determined by its long-term returns, not short-term fluctuations or gut feelings.\nYour attitude determines my response. \u0026ndash; James\nJames adjusts his responses based on the learning attitude of the attendees. Attendees who are truly dedicated to learning will receive greater guidance.\nInvesting in individual stocks will ultimately lead to bankruptcy; holding onto individual stocks will also ultimately lead to bankruptcy.\n\u0026ndash; James\nCompanies have lifecycles. Holding onto a single stock long term significantly increases the risk of encountering bankruptcy. Diversification is key in investing.\nV. Summary # This live session once again emphasized the importance of long-term investing while reminding attendees to stay rational, patient, and vigilant. James addressed attendees\u0026rsquo; questions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and the relationship between money and values, sharing personal experiences and insights.

Theme of the Episode # The theme of this episode is \u0026ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.\u0026rdquo; The core viewpoints are: Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.\nII. Summary of the Briefing # Wealth is a Gift: Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that \u0026ldquo;wealth is a gift,\u0026rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth. The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest: Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment. High Risk, High Return?: High risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ. Choosing Investment Targets: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years. Investment Mindset: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights. Asset Allocation: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you. Do Not Blindly Trust External Information: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy. Balancing Risk and Reward: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # IM:\nSharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion 1: What do you think about the idea that \u0026ldquo;investing is simple\u0026rdquo;?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment. Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don\u0026rsquo;t understand index investing?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it\u0026rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual. LAN:\nQuestion 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value. Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher. Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value. Question 4: For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Don\u0026rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term. Nai Xin:\nSharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success. Jason:\nSharing: Understanding \u0026ldquo;buy whenever you have money,\u0026rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply. James\u0026rsquo; Response: Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes. IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that \u0026ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.\u0026rdquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns. Hai Rui Ji:\nSharing:\nThank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together. James\u0026rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** \u0026ldquo;Never sell\u0026rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.** Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment. Question: Already answered in the video.\nLi Zi:\nSharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading. James\u0026rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of \u0026ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.\u0026rdquo; T:\nQuestion 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries. Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?\nJames\u0026rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels. IV. Key Takeaways # Wealth is a Gift \u0026ndash; James\nEveryone has the potential for wealth, but they must be informed to realize it and learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.\nLearning Increases Daily, the Dao Decreases Daily \u0026ndash; IM\nLearning about investing and financial management is a process of continuous improvement. At first, you will be exposed to a large amount of information, but as your understanding deepens, you will gradually simplify your investment strategy and eventually reach the state of \u0026ldquo;the great Dao is simple.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Difficult to Return to After Seeing a Vast Ocean \u0026ndash; Li Zi \u0026amp; James\nOnly after experiencing something can you know what is best. In investing, only after actually operating and experiencing market fluctuations and the impact of different investment strategies can you more firmly choose the long-term investment strategy that suits you.\nThe More Money You Borrow, the More Money You Have \u0026ndash; James\nUnderstand and control risk, not avoid it. Understanding how to use leverage can accelerate wealth growth, but only with proper risk management, such as building a solid asset allocation.\nCash is Air \u0026ndash; James\nCash is very important and you must keep enough cash to deal with market fluctuations and emergencies.\nV. Summary # This live stream focused on the theme of \u0026ldquo;Wealth is a gift.\u0026rdquo; James explained the importance of investing and financial management, the advantages of index investing, the relationship between risk tolerance and investment returns, and how to conduct reasonable asset allocation in a simple and profound way. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, students actively questioned their own issues and confusions. James patiently and meticulously answered them by combining practical cases and his own experience, helping the students better understand and master the knowledge and methods of investing and financial management. He also guided the students to overcome psychological barriers in investments, establish a firm long-term investment philosophy, and ultimately achieve financial freedom.\nDisclaimer: This article is a personal learning summary and does not constitute any investment advice.

Main Topic # This lecture focuses on how to make sound asset allocation and investment decisions amidst economic fluctuations and market uncertainty. The core message is to prioritize long-term, value-based investing, avoid chasing market highs and lows, and develop a rational investment strategy based on individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Avoid blindly following trends and emotional market reactions.\nII. Lecture Summary # Central Bank Policy and the Economy: Central banks primarily focus on inflation and unemployment. Economic recessions are typically accompanied by rising unemployment, prompting central banks to implement policies like quantitative easing to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. For instance, quantitative easing during the subprime mortgage crisis and the pandemic aimed to address rising unemployment. Risks of Chinese Stocks: James reiterates his advice against investing in Chinese stocks, using his personal experience of recommending selling off Chinese stocks at the beginning of the US-China trade war as evidence of their risk. He mentions Nio\u0026rsquo;s price surge from $16 to $30-$40, followed by a significant drop, illustrating the high volatility and risk associated with Chinese stocks. Asset Allocation Strategy: James emphasizes that asset allocation and the amount of capital available for investment are two distinct concepts. The correct buying strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money,\u0026rdquo; not dollar-cost averaging. This is similar to the 401k or retirement account investment strategy, where early investment is encouraged to maximize the benefits of compounding. Insurance Choices: He advises against purchasing commercial insurance, particularly investment-linked insurance products, arguing that they offer low returns and poor liquidity. He recommends Term Life Insurance and Medical Care insurance for managing unforeseen risks. For example, a Term Life policy might cost only a few hundred dollars a year for $1 million in coverage. He discourages purchasing other commercial insurance products like long-term care insurance and universal life insurance, viewing them as a waste of money that could be better used for investments. The Concept of Leveraged Investing: James introduces the concept of leveraged investing, suggesting that borrowing at low interest rates to invest in high-return assets can be a sound strategy. For example, with loan interest rates at 2%-7% and potential asset appreciation of 10%-12%, leveraged investing can be more profitable in the long run. He illustrates this with a hypothetical example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, your assets will remain at $1 million after ten years. However, if you borrow money to invest that $1 million, even after deducting annual expenses and 7% interest, your assets could grow to $30 million in 30 years, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million. III. Q\u0026amp;A Session # Mike:\nQuestion: You use T-Mobile; why don\u0026rsquo;t you have Starlink as a backup? Answer: My apartment building doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow Starlink installation, and the T-Mobile signal is generally good. Network interruptions are rare and usually resolved by restarting the router. Mike:\nComment: Some YouTubers claim that the central bank ignores economic recessions. Question: Is this true? Answer: The central bank focuses on the unemployment rate, which is highly correlated with economic recessions. Therefore, the central bank doesn\u0026rsquo;t ignore recessions, but rather focuses on a different indicator. Many YouTubers are not professional financial advisors; don\u0026rsquo;t be misled. Jason:\nQuestion: Can I dollar-cost average into leveraged funds in my retirement account without rebalancing? Answer: Your question indicates a misunderstanding of asset allocation. Asset allocation and dollar-cost averaging are different concepts. The correct buying strategy is \u0026ldquo;buy when you have money.\u0026rdquo; Leveraged funds are volatile and are better purchased in a lump sum. The same applies to QQQ. PC:\nComment: A friend surrendered their investment-linked insurance policy and invested the proceeds in 00670L (2x leveraged ETF), recovering their losses within two weeks. Summary: Don\u0026rsquo;t be trapped by sunk costs. Cut your losses promptly and reallocate your assets effectively. Wolf:\nQuestion: I\u0026rsquo;m ten years from retirement with limited retirement savings. Can I take advantage of market downturns to buy QLD in my Roth IRA and convert my 401k to cash? Answer: With limited Roth IRA funds, you should invest entirely in leveraged funds. Hold an equivalent amount of cash in your 401k. For example, if you buy $100,000 of QLD, hold $100,000 in cash in your 401k. If your Roth IRA only has $30,000, invest it all in TQQQ and hold $60,000 cash in your 401k. This strategy aims for higher returns due to the Roth IRA\u0026rsquo;s lower contribution limits. IAM:\nComment: The devaluation of the Malaysian currency brings to mind the impact of migration on currency, such as wealthy individuals from Hong Kong migrating. How does the US avoid currency devaluation, and do US companies benefit from the US dollar? Answer: A country\u0026rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by its industries and national strength. The US has four pillars: government, finance, corporations, and national defense. Whether US companies benefit from the dollar is uncertain, but they are undoubtedly protected by the US government. James uses a hypothetical \u0026ldquo;James currency\u0026rdquo; (10 point) example: The value of a currency depends on the issuer\u0026rsquo;s services and creditworthiness. For example, 10 points could be exchanged for a meal. If others recognize the value of the James currency, it can circulate. T:\nQuestion: Do you still consider market cycles in your investing approach? Answer: I will continue to discuss cycles, but cycle-based trades will be anticipated, potentially three months, six months, or even a year in advance, and may be incorrect. I will no longer advocate for all-in/all-out strategies, but rather adjusting Beta. This is because managing a large volume of funds from many individuals makes rapid market entry and exit difficult and prone to market impact. It\u0026rsquo;s better to invest the annual $7,000 contribution as a lump sum rather than in installments; long-term performance will likely be better. Lump-sum investing in the US market has historically outperformed dollar-cost averaging or periodic investments. YJ:\nQuestion: Why allocate to 00864B? Why is 00757 no longer recommended? What advice do you have for Taiwanese investors? Answer: Asset allocation strategies are generally universal. 00864B is similar to a US dollar time deposit but carries exchange rate risk. Refer to the 2021-2022 videos for information on 00757. The main difference between investing in Taiwan and the US lies in pledging. Maintain a loan-to-value ratio above 167%, avoid pledging all assets, and diversify pledges across multiple financial institutions to mitigate the risk of credit lines being reduced. For instance, if you have $50 million in assets, don\u0026rsquo;t pledge all of it; start by pledging 1/3, enough to cover your needs, and seek other financial institutions for additional pledging needs. Taiwanese financial institutions have fluctuating credit lines, so be cautious. Little John:\nQuestion: Why borrow against assets instead of selling stocks? Answer: Pledging assets offers lower interest rates (2%-7%) compared to the potential for higher asset appreciation (10%-12%). Using loans for investment is more cost-effective and avoids capital gains taxes from selling stocks. Example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, you\u0026rsquo;ll still have $1 million after ten years. But if you borrow and invest, even after 30 years of expenses and interest payments, your assets could grow to $30 million, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million after paying off the loan. Cristina:\nQuestion: Questions about annuities and what to do with funds after selling a house. Answer: Avoid annuities; surrender them if you have any. Proceeds from a house sale cannot be put into an IRA or Roth IRA; they should be placed in a brokerage account. IV.
