He advises everyone to invest in the Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ or 00662) and view market fluctuations with a long-term perspective.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A new bull market is coming:</strong>  The world has entered an era of loose monetary policy with the start of a rate cut cycle, which will drive the stock market up. This bull market may be a slow one but will continuously rise.</li>
<li><strong>Invest confidently in the Nasdaq 100 index fund:</strong> QQQ could increase by 50 times in the next 20 years, with an annualized return of over 20%, making it the best investment target.</li>
<li><strong>Individual stocks are unreliable:</strong> Individual stock investment is risky, and in the long run, almost all of them will disappear. They are very difficult to outperform the market in the long term. It is recommended not to waste time and energy on stock selection.</li>
<li><strong>Do not invest in the Chinese stock market:</strong> The Chinese stock market is not mature enough; consider investing in it after 30 years.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison of household asset allocation in the US and Taiwan:</strong>  American families invest most of their assets in securities to create social value, while Taiwanese families prefer cash, insurance, and real estate, locking up funds in non-appreciating areas.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging through stock pledges:</strong> Using stock pledges to borrow increases liquidity and allows for continued investment to enjoy the benefits of compound growth. With an understanding of asset allocation, the interest cost of borrowing can be almost negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for retirement early:</strong> Young people are advised to invest in 00662, and retirees can choose 00646 (SPY) or 0056 according to their fund size.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize family education:</strong> Parents should cultivate their children&rsquo;s financial management concepts from an early age, guide them to make long-term investments, stay away from bad habits such as short-term speculation and gambling, and lead by example.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blindly trust high-yield investment products:</strong> Any investment product promising high returns may be a scam. It is important to understand its operating mechanism and learn to discern between true and false.</li>
<li><strong>The dangers of short-term trading:</strong> Short-term trading will miss the best investment opportunities. Long-term investment in index funds will yield more stable returns.</li>
<li><strong>The purpose of cash allocation:</strong> It is not for profit, but for dealing with emergencies like unemployment or a market crash. It is advisable to keep more than 10% of your assets in cash.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Lending is more powerful than the atomic bomb; it&rsquo;s ten times the atomic bomb!
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When encouraging people to use stock pledges for borrowing and investment, James used this analogy to vividly illustrate the power of leverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investing should be easy and fun.
&ndash;  Hola</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what a listener said when she shared her investment experience. She also tried short-term trading, but finally found that long-term investment suited her better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each person has a different destiny when it comes to money.
&ndash; Peter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter said this thought-provoking sentence when he shared his experience of persuading his father to invest in QQQ. This also reflects that investment and financial management should be combined with one&rsquo;s own situation to find a suitable way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the money in the world is mine; you just need to take it and use it.
&ndash; James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James used humorous words to express his confidence in the market when encouraging everyone to invest, which also reflects his optimistic and positive attitude towards life.</p>

<p>The theme of this episode is &ldquo;Investing and Financial Management, Wealth is a Gift.&rdquo; The core viewpoints  are: <strong>Wealth is innate, but one must be informed to realize it; investing and financial management is an important way to accumulate wealth; index investing is an effective method to achieve long-term stable growth; rational asset allocation and risk control are the keys to investment success; and overcoming psychological barriers in investment and solidifying the long-term investment philosophy are crucial to ultimately achieving financial freedom.</strong></p>

    </span>        
    
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth is a Gift:</strong> Wealth is innate, and being informed of this fact makes a huge difference. While successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are a minority, most people need to be told that &ldquo;wealth is a gift,&rdquo; and they need to learn how to invest and manage their finances to achieve wealth growth.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Index Investing and Compound Interest:</strong> Index investing is an effective way to achieve long-term stable returns, and its compounding effect is astonishing. For example, investing $1,500 per month for 40 years with a 14% annualized return will yield $2.6 million. <strong>Even small amounts of money can accumulate considerable wealth through consistent long-term investment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Risk, High Return?</strong>: High risk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to high returns. Whether you can bear the risk determines whether you can ultimately achieve high returns. Don&rsquo;t overestimate your risk tolerance. Your risk appetite should be determined by an asset allocation that you can withstand even if your investment goes to zero. <strong>For example, if you cannot afford the risk of TQQQ going to zero, you should not invest in TQQQ.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choosing Investment Targets</strong>: It is recommended to invest in the global Nasdaq 100 index fund (QQQ). Those with insufficient funds or who are already retired can consider investing in SPY or high-dividend ETFs. Avoid investing in individual stocks because they tend to disappear over the long term, while index funds can continue to exist. <strong>The half-life of individual stocks is 10 years; out of 100 stocks, there may be less than three left after 50 years.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment Mindset</strong>: The market will eventually rise, and investment requires patience. Always stay optimistic, even if the investment goes to zero. Learning about investing and financial management requires continuous thinking, like peeling an onion, layer by layer, to elevate the energy of the spiritual level. <strong>Investing is like the Yellow Mountain, eternally unchanging, yet different every day; every learning experience will bring new insights.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation</strong>: Asset allocation is like building a house; it is a big project that requires comprehensive planning, not something simple. It is necessary to consider many factors, such as whether you are retired, your age, income, debt, and cash flow, to formulate a reasonable asset allocation plan. <strong>You need to carefully study the articles and videos on asset allocation provided by James to develop a plan that suits you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do Not  Blindly Trust External Information</strong>: Financial professionals often only consider their interests, so do not easily believe their advice. Think independently, study carefully, and do not be swayed by external information and noise. <strong>Most of the outside information is garbage; do not be affected by it, focus on learning James&rsquo; investment philosophy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Balancing Risk and Reward</strong>: Do not excessively pursue high returns or completely risk-free investments; balance risk and reward. Avoid changing investment strategies easily to prevent additional costs due to frequent trading. <strong>James&rsquo; investment methods can guarantee asset appreciation and relative safety, avoiding extreme situations.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing: Learning about investment is like peeling an onion; at first, the amount of information is overwhelming, but as you learn more, you will gradually understand the core idea and ultimately reach the realm of &ldquo;the great Dao is simple.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 1: What do you think about the idea that &ldquo;investing is simple&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Such views often mistake ignorance for inaction and do not truly understand the complexity and risks of investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: How should we communicate with friends who don&rsquo;t understand index investing?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can start by briefly introducing the concept and advantages of index investing and suggest that they watch related videos to learn. Don&rsquo;t force them to accept it, everyone has their own choices. <strong>Just like preaching, we can only try our best to spread the message; whether it&rsquo;s ultimately accepted depends on the individual.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LAN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: How to calculate Beta? What is the actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can refer to the link to the article on Beta calculation on the message board. The actual Beta value of a leveraged ETF may deviate from the theoretical value due to factors such as market volatility and friction costs. <strong>When market volatility is large, the wear and tear of leveraged ETFs will be more serious, resulting in an actual Beta value lower than the theoretical value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Why is there a huge difference in final return between scenario 3 and scenario 4.1 in the 005 topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Scenario 4.1 is where no money is withdrawn from the investment, so the final return will be higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 3: How to adjust Beta in a rising market?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  The adjustment of Beta should be determined by your own risk tolerance, not by the market trend. <strong>Do not try to predict the market, just keep a fixed Beta value.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 4:  For investments in Taiwan, should I choose Q2D or 00670L?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: 00670L is recommended because it includes New Taiwan dollar hedging, which can reduce the risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. <strong>Don&rsquo;t change investment targets frequently, choose one that suits you and hold it for the long term.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nai Xin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Wealth is a gift, just as self-confidence is a gift; everyone has potential, but it needs to be stimulated. The key to investing and financial management lies in learning. Once you have mastered the correct investment method, you can focus on your own career and life and let wealth grow naturally over time. <strong>Overcome fear, build confidence, and you can realize your potential, gain wealth, and achieve success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: Understanding &ldquo;buy whenever you have money,&rdquo; but still finding it difficult to overcome psychological fluctuations when the market rises or falls sharply.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response:  Overcoming psychological fluctuations takes time and experience. You can try to make a small number of trades, experience the impact of market fluctuations, and gradually adapt to market changes.</li>
<li>IM Supplement: You can overcome psychological barriers by imagining starting to invest two years later and understanding that &ldquo;money arrives at different points in time.&rdquo;<strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about buying at the lowest point; as long as you stick to long-term investment, you can get good returns.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Hai Rui Ji:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you James for selflessly sharing your investment philosophy; students learn from each other and make progress together.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; investment philosophy requires continuous learning and understanding to grasp it fully. &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; does not mean you cannot sell, but that you should develop a reasonable investment strategy based on your own situation. ** &ldquo;Never sell&rdquo; refers to mentally ignoring market fluctuations and adhering to a long-term investment philosophy.**</li>
<li>Investment philosophy needs to keep pace with the times and adjust investment strategies according to changes in the environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question: Already answered in the video.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Li Zi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing: To overcome psychological barriers to investment, manage accounts separately, using one part for long-term investment and the other for tentative operations, such as selling covered calls. This satisfies the desire to trade and avoids losses due to frequent trading.
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You only know what is best after you have experienced it. Experience in trading can lead to a firmer commitment to a long-term investment strategy. <strong>Trying different trading strategies can help you understand the advantages of long-term investment and ultimately achieve the state of &ldquo;daily reduction for the Dao.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question 1: Why has the capital market in mainland China performed poorly for a long time?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: Emerging markets take time to mature. The Chinese market is like the Taiwanese market 50 years ago. It has the potential to rise in the long term, but its return may be lower than that of the US market. <strong>Investment should focus on sustainable development markets. The US market has advantages in terms of systems and industries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question 2: Under foreign exchange control, how do I invest in US index funds? Are there any risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>James&rsquo; Response: You can invest by purchasing ETFs listed in China that track US index funds, such as 513100. Foreign exchange controls mainly restrict the physical flow of funds, and buying ETFs is not restricted. The current scale of such investment is small and will not trigger a quota limit. <strong>Even with foreign exchange control, it is still possible to allocate global assets through legal channels.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Central Bank Policy and the Economy:</strong> Central banks primarily focus on inflation and unemployment. Economic recessions are typically accompanied by rising unemployment, prompting central banks to implement policies like quantitative easing to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.  For instance, quantitative easing during the subprime mortgage crisis and the pandemic aimed to address rising unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Risks of Chinese Stocks:</strong> James reiterates his advice against investing in Chinese stocks, using his personal experience of recommending selling off Chinese stocks at the beginning of the US-China trade war as evidence of their risk.  He mentions Nio&rsquo;s price surge from $16 to $30-$40, followed by a significant drop, illustrating the high volatility and risk associated with Chinese stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Allocation Strategy:</strong>  James emphasizes that asset allocation and the amount of capital available for investment are two distinct concepts.  The correct buying strategy is &ldquo;buy when you have money,&rdquo; not dollar-cost averaging. This is similar to the 401k or retirement account investment strategy, where early investment is encouraged to maximize the benefits of compounding.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance Choices:</strong>  He advises against purchasing commercial insurance, particularly investment-linked insurance products, arguing that they offer low returns and poor liquidity. He recommends Term Life Insurance and Medical Care insurance for managing unforeseen risks.  For example, a Term Life policy might cost only a few hundred dollars a year for $1 million in coverage. He discourages purchasing other commercial insurance products like long-term care insurance and universal life insurance, viewing them as a waste of money that could be better used for investments.</li>
<li><strong>The Concept of Leveraged Investing:</strong>  James introduces the concept of leveraged investing, suggesting that borrowing at low interest rates to invest in high-return assets can be a sound strategy. For example, with loan interest rates at 2%-7% and potential asset appreciation of 10%-12%, leveraged investing can be more profitable in the long run. He illustrates this with a hypothetical example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, your assets will remain at $1 million after ten years. However, if you borrow money to invest that $1 million, even after deducting annual expenses and 7% interest, your assets could grow to $30 million in 30 years, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million.</li>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: You use T-Mobile; why don&rsquo;t you have Starlink as a backup?</li>
<li>Answer: My apartment building doesn&rsquo;t allow Starlink installation, and the T-Mobile signal is generally good. Network interruptions are rare and usually resolved by restarting the router.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: Some YouTubers claim that the central bank ignores economic recessions.</li>
<li>Question: Is this true?</li>
<li>Answer: The central bank focuses on the unemployment rate, which is highly correlated with economic recessions.  Therefore, the central bank doesn&rsquo;t ignore recessions, but rather focuses on a different indicator.  Many YouTubers are not professional financial advisors; don&rsquo;t be misled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Can I dollar-cost average into leveraged funds in my retirement account without rebalancing?</li>
<li>Answer: Your question indicates a misunderstanding of asset allocation.  Asset allocation and dollar-cost averaging are different concepts.  The correct buying strategy is &ldquo;buy when you have money.&rdquo; Leveraged funds are volatile and are better purchased in a lump sum.  The same applies to QQQ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: A friend surrendered their investment-linked insurance policy and invested the proceeds in 00670L (2x leveraged ETF), recovering their losses within two weeks.</li>
<li>Summary: Don&rsquo;t be trapped by sunk costs. Cut your losses promptly and reallocate your assets effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wolf:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: I&rsquo;m ten years from retirement with limited retirement savings. Can I take advantage of market downturns to buy QLD in my Roth IRA and convert my 401k to cash?</li>
<li>Answer:  With limited Roth IRA funds, you should invest entirely in leveraged funds.  Hold an equivalent amount of cash in your 401k. For example, if you buy $100,000 of QLD, hold $100,000 in cash in your 401k. If your Roth IRA only has $30,000, invest it all in TQQQ and hold $60,000 cash in your 401k. This strategy aims for higher returns due to the Roth IRA&rsquo;s lower contribution limits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comment: The devaluation of the Malaysian currency brings to mind the impact of migration on currency, such as wealthy individuals from Hong Kong migrating. How does the US avoid currency devaluation, and do US companies benefit from the US dollar?</li>
<li>Answer: A country&rsquo;s currency value depends on its creditworthiness, which is backed by its industries and national strength.  The US has four pillars: government, finance, corporations, and national defense.  Whether US companies benefit from the dollar is uncertain, but they are undoubtedly protected by the US government.  James uses a hypothetical &ldquo;James currency&rdquo; (10 point) example:  The value of a currency depends on the issuer&rsquo;s services and creditworthiness.  For example, 10 points could be exchanged for a meal. If others recognize the value of the James currency, it can circulate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Do you still consider market cycles in your investing approach?</li>
<li>Answer: I will continue to discuss cycles, but cycle-based trades will be anticipated, potentially three months, six months, or even a year in advance, and may be incorrect. I will no longer advocate for all-in/all-out strategies, but rather adjusting Beta. This is because managing a large volume of funds from many individuals makes rapid market entry and exit difficult and prone to market impact.  It&rsquo;s better to invest the annual $7,000 contribution as a lump sum rather than in installments; long-term performance will likely be better.  Lump-sum investing in the US market has historically outperformed dollar-cost averaging or periodic investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YJ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Why allocate to 00864B?  Why is 00757 no longer recommended?  What advice do you have for Taiwanese investors?</li>
<li>Answer: Asset allocation strategies are generally universal. 00864B is similar to a US dollar time deposit but carries exchange rate risk. Refer to the 2021-2022 videos for information on 00757. The main difference between investing in Taiwan and the US lies in pledging.  Maintain a loan-to-value ratio above 167%, avoid pledging all assets, and diversify pledges across multiple financial institutions to mitigate the risk of credit lines being reduced. For instance, if you have $50 million in assets, don&rsquo;t pledge all of it; start by pledging 1/3, enough to cover your needs, and seek other financial institutions for additional pledging needs. Taiwanese financial institutions have fluctuating credit lines, so be cautious.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Little John:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Why borrow against assets instead of selling stocks?</li>
<li>Answer:  Pledging assets offers lower interest rates (2%-7%) compared to the potential for higher asset appreciation (10%-12%).  Using loans for investment is more cost-effective and avoids capital gains taxes from selling stocks.  Example: If you have $1 million and spend $100,000 annually, you&rsquo;ll still have $1 million after ten years. But if you borrow and invest, even after 30 years of expenses and interest payments, your assets could grow to $30 million, resulting in a net profit of over $20 million after paying off the loan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cristina:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Question: Questions about annuities and what to do with funds after selling a house.</li>
<li>Answer: Avoid annuities; surrender them if you have any.  Proceeds from a house sale cannot be put into an IRA or Roth IRA; they should be placed in a brokerage account.</li>
</ul>
